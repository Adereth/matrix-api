Experimental Matrix / Vector API for Clojure

The idea is to provide a common abstraction for matrix maths in Clojure, 
independent of underlying implementations.

Example implementations we might want to support:

 - Parallel Colt
 - JBLAS / clatrix
 - Vectorz
 - javax.vecmath (part of Java3D)
 - Simple matrices constructed from Clojure vectors
 - EJML
 - and probably many more....

### Do not use yet!

Contributions / ideas welcome however.

This is an open proof of concept.
