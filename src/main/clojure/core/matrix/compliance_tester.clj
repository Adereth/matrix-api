;; ====================================
;; COMPLIANCE TESTING
;;
;; test suite that implementations can call to test
;; adherence to core.matrix API contracts
;;
;; Note that tests need to be written in a very generic way
;; - they can't assume anything other than documented API behaviour!
;; 
;; e.g. can't assume that scalar values are always Doubles etc.
